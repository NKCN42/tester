Notes: 11/10/11

Pre-class:
use "bundle exec spork" and "rails server" on two visible terminal windows when working.

1) Added logo image from cs4413 site to tester/app/assets/images
2) Extracted blueprint zip (link on cs4413 site) to Desktop, 
   dragged extracted zip to tester/app/assets/stylesheets
3) "heroku create --stack cedar" used to create heroku remote reference. 
4) pushed to git and heroku

5) New style of working: check out master, then branch, then push. 
   Details here: http://cs.utsa.edu/~cs4413/lectures/GitTechnology.html
       Using style 2 for this assignment.
       git checkout -b static-pages
	NOTE: when branching, you may want to restart your spork and rails servers.       
	
	To check back in,
	"git add"
	"git commit"
	"git push" 
	"git checkout master"
	"git merge static-pages"
